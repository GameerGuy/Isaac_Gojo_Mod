Limitless:
-Small speed up.
-Creates a forcefield around isaac that protects against enemies and projectiles.
-Strength of forcefield is proportional to (current active charge/max active charge) * max active charge.
-Strength determins forcefield effect radius and effect scaling.

Convergence:


Divergence:


When both convergence and divergence are at full charge and used simultaneously:
-Fire off hollow purple.
-
